      <h1>Summer nights</h1>
    <p>Those summer nights<br>
         Summer nights<br>
         I need to think of my life<br>
         my life<br>
         when the sun's in love

         <br><br>
         with the sky<br>
         Yea, yea, yea<br>
         African violet and neon blue<br>
         
         <br>
         suits my eyes
         <br>

         who want the sun<br>
         who want the sun, don't you?<br>
         <br>
         you want the sun<br>
         you want the sun, don't you?<br>
         who want the sun<br>
         who want the sun, don't you?<br>
         <br>
         you want the sun<br><br>

         you want the sun, don't you?<br><br>

         I'm in love<br>
         I'm in love<br>
         But I need to know that we're good<br>
         oh<br>
         <br>
         You been checking the ground wherever I been<br>
         So far, so far, baby<br><br>

         But this time, this love is rock, love is rock<br>
         You need to be staying<br><br>

         who want the sun<br>
         who want the sun, don't you?<br>
         you want the sun<br>
         you want the sun, don't you?<br>
         who want the sun<br>
         who want the sun, don't you?<br>
         you want the sun<br>
         you want the sun, don't you?</p>
